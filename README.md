# Polycrystalline graphene samples

Polycrystalline graphene samples generated for the paper "Efficient structural relaxation of polycrystalline graphene models", Federico Dâ€™Ambrosio, Joris Barkema and Gerard T. Barkema, to be published (2021).

- 3200 atoms at 625 eV;
- 3200 atoms at ~200 eV, relaxed with the Early Rejection method (section 2.1 and 3.1);
- 3200 atoms at ~200 eV, relaxed with full relaxation after each bond transposition;
- 10024 atoms at 696 eV;
- 20000 atoms at 1488 eV; 

The samples are available under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. If you're using them for your research, we would appreciate a citation. 

The samples are tab-separated files with the following format.

- A prelude with:
```
Periodic boundaries size on the x-axis
Periodic boundaries size on the y-axis
Angle (ignored in single layer graphene)
Energy (for reference)
```
Followed by the location of all the atoms as:
```
AtomId Position (x)  Position (y)  Position (z) 
```
Finally, the bonds:
```
BondId Atom1 Atom2
```
